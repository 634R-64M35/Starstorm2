BUT NOW, HE THREATENS OUR HOME ONCE AGAIN.\n\nIF YOU SEE HIM, DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM. HE WILL TRY TO SWAY YOU TO HIS SIDE, WITH PROMISES OF WARMTH AND SAFETY AND STRENGTH.\n\nIT IS A TRAP.\n\nONCE HE HAS YOUR TRUST, YOU WILL BE A SLAVE TO HIS LIGHT. YOU WILL BEAR YOUR OWN CHAINS, JUST AS HE BEARS HIS OWN.\n\n...\n\nBUT - DO NOT WORRY. I WILL PROTECT THE GARDEN. IF HE HAS THE AUDACITY TO RETURN TO ME, THAT IS.\n\nAS FOR YOU, LITTLE ONES, I HAVE A GIFT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. COME CLOSER.\n\nCLOSER NOW!\n\nNOW, WATCH - WATCH HERE. WATCH MY HAND.\n\nYOU ALL WILL HELP ME TEND TO THE GARDEN.",
