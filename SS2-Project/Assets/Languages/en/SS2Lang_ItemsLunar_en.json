Has something hurt you?\n\nYou found something that hurt you? Hmm. Peculiar. Do you have it with you, still?\n\n...I see. Let me look at it, then. Come now, and show me what you've found.\n\nHmm. A strange thing, this one. A blazing fire, yet cold to the touch. How unnatural, this is. There's a certain harmony to it, however. As the heat brings warmth and life, the cold tempers it, and keeps it in check. But in that same way, that bitter cold may bring despair and death without the heat to stave it off.\n\n...Oh, but there I go, rambling once more. You need to be taken care of, Youngling. Please, come with me.",

You are not hiding things from me, Youngling?\n\n...You found something very heavy. I see. Forgive me for my suspicions. Show me this thing you have found.\n\nAh! You are correct, Youngling. This thing is small, but difficult to hold. It splinters and fragments, and each piece is just as heavy as the whole. What a remarkable thing, this is!\n\nI will put it with the other wonderful things you have found. A thing like this could be dangerous if it fell into the wrong hands. As for you, Youngling... Hmm, I believe some repairs for your bag are in order. Come with me.",

Have you found anything else?\n\nAh, you have? Let me see it then, youngling.\n\nOh! This shape that you've found! It is stalwart, but not loyal. Powerful, but yet also frail at the same time. It is a peculiar shape, to say the least of it. Where did you find this, youngling?\n\n...You found it on the planet? Hmm. Worrisome. This was not created by those sandfolk. Too complex, too powerful. Nor by those Lemurians. Tell me, youngling, you did not steal this, did you?\n\n...You did not. I see. Very well. I would like to keep this shape. This shape is dangerous if you do not understand it.\n\nOh, my youngling, do not look so saddened. This shape is remarkable, and I laud your work regardless of this. I simply want to keep it safe. Here, perhaps a reward is in order. Come with me."
