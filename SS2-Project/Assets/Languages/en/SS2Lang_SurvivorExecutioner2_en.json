Bullets loaded, ion manipulators charged.'\n\n<color=#CCD3E0> < ! > Use Service Pistol to score some kills, with each kill building up an even stronger Ion Burst.\n\n< ! > You can tap Ion Burst to fire a few shots, or hold it to fire them all.\n\n< ! > Execution is a great crowd control AND single target tool. Don't forget that its damage depends on how many targets it hits!\n\n< ! > If you find yourself getting swarmed, Crowd Dispersion can get enemies off your back fast.",

And death in glorious combat is one of the best deaths a man could ask for.\n\nBut, as always, some would seek to run from death. We call them by many names. Deserters, cowards, turncoats. Each and every one of them, traitors to the cause. These traitors must be punished for their crime. And that punishment: in an ironic twist, is the very thing they tried to avoid.\n\nDeath will come for them. Not as a robed spectre with a scythe. Not in a trench coat, holding a revolver. Not as a sickness, nor the wear of time. No. For them, death will come bearing lustrous battlegarb, with service pistol loaded, and ion manipulators fully charged.",
